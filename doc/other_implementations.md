Studied some of the existing implementation choices.

## raftoscope (functional approach)

- javascript implementation
- implemented a set of rules (function / procedure), each rules defines the conditions of application

- loop for managing all

- stack of communication, handling the reception of the message (permit to simulate)


## canonical (active approach)

- C implementation
- implements an "agent related" implementation "by state" (leader/follower/candidate)
